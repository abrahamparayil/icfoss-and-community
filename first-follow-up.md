# First follow-up after Community's response

The community patiently awaited the then Director Sabarish K to address the 
community's response officially. A few weeks later the [Free Software Community 
of India] on their online discussions and decision making platform codema.in
requested a community member to volunteer to follow up with the Director 
regarding the same. I volunteered for the task in the Matrix Room of FSCI and 
the same was updated on Codema as well.

Hence on Tue, Aug 25, 2020 I sent the director the mail below inquiring about 
the status of his response.

>Hey,

To which he replied:

>this is based on the baeless news paper reports.

For better or for worse I decided to give him a chance and didn't make this email public. I do regret that now. Anyway I ended up replying:

August 27 2020:

    Respected Sir,

    Will keep the mail to myself. I'm glad to know that you're trying to make a difference. I and I'm pretty sure the community too, will support you in any way we can for the social cause that is Free Software. Hope everything goes well with the Finance Inspection Team, best wishes for the same.

    Looking forward to turning new leaves,

    Abraham Raji

(I must have been having a really good day because I'm not usually this nice. Maybe I thought something good would happen this time and a little positive feedback would be good.)

But I was wrong. No reply.

So I sent another mail:

November 1 2020:

    Hey Sir,

    The free software communities in Kerala had sent you a letter detailing their expectations from ICFOSS, how together both parties can build a better FOSS ecosystem in Kerala, upon your request. We have yet to receive an official reply for the letter from you. This is an email to inquire about the status of the official reply, why is it getting delayed and when we can expect it.

    Sincerely,

    Abraham Raji
