**- He also underscored the need for thinking in terms of feat**

** as opposed to current product development attitude**

"Regarding Sebins point as an individual or an organisation, we cannot go against the government, but through proper interventions of like.minded people in the ministry and beurocratic grp we may be able to change."

"Regarding Malayalam computing, one of the request is to have good unique typefaces, and plans to develop 5 openfonts, 2 CdIT has agreed, 2 nos can give it to community if a group consisting of designers and techies join together and mail a proposal along with honorarium for the final product, ICFOSS will evaluate it within. Week's time and release the order  Which has to be ready by October 15."

**- Amarnath Raja proposed to survey the Free Software adoption in govt departments to have an idea of the numbers to help further campaigns**

"What Amar sir told is very essential and the socio economic impact of Libre software in Kerala has to documented In government as well as in social front, I already has requested help of some MTech students, as After Covid mobilty is at stake and has to confine data collection from home, Any âœ‹ for this, we may give give this to planning board as we'll so that will.be an indicator for subsequent policy adoptions"

**- Sebin suggested ICFOSS should allow all its workers to spend 20% of its work hours to spend on community projects similar to how corporates like Google. Srinivasan from ICFOSS clarified such a policy already exist, though its not very effective**

"Regarding dedicating 20 percentage time for activities, I will issue a circular"

"One pls compile a list the major areas of expertise/ work contacts, I will publish it for public scrutiny and those agreeable to the community will.be published as final list"

**- KSEB project documentation will be published as case study**

"Regarding certain things which falls under the KSEBs jurisdiction, ICFOSS cannot intervene, but KSEBs oruma team is very much active may request them to take it up with their management." [could be in response to a different point above]

"Kseb case study is already published I hope or it can be made as a lighthouse case study in the impact of Libre software in Kerala report planned."

"Community organised projects - not all ,but programmes which stands the scrutiny of a committee in which at least 2 members will be from the community and  within the funding limit will be supported."

**- ICFOSS will involve community in fellowship selection process**

"Involving community in selection, in this case community is a broad term, I need names of Captains who can be in the selection board, a roster which will be on a round robin mode. Otherwise if I include Shyam, Naveen and Akshay s Dinesh will say I am syams man. So to avoid that pls select the captain's and share the Names and as I mentioned 2 members will.be there, but it shouldn't be a never ending parallels, let the lines slant and converge."

**- ICFOSS servers will be accessible for free software projects as soon as the current server maintenance is over**

"Reg Server Access, I have to discuss with my team and will revert back."

Points raised as follow-up in the conversation above
----------------------------------------------------

**akshay: waiting for you to reach the points about funding, community engagement, etc. But please do go ahead point by point. Thanks for doing this.**

"Regarding funding let us be democratic, it is a time where RTI is being weponised, so we need to frame a guideline for funding, fixing criteria, who all can volunteer in this task"

**naveenpf: community grants  can be split as **

**1\. Project grant**

**2\. Events and Travel grant**

**Project grant proposals can be invited once in a month in a year.**

**Events and travel grant proposal invited anytime.**

**Grants committee should be formed with community members. All depends on yearly budget for community grant.**

**Structure for fund expenditure reporting template should be in place. (can be reused from wikimedia grants reporting)**

"Our budget was cut 30percent initially and 90 percentage of funds set apart for seminar, travel was also cut Covid to blame."

"This is a good suggestion, biggest task before me is to frame meticulously charted guidelines for each of the external funding progs. Otherwise it may be the Next Story of Nepotism.."

116.8KB PDF named SR17Guidelines.pdf <https://t.me/ic_foss/3038>

"This is what I mean a structured document published in the website and an online application system"

**Hrishi: Adding to this, **

**Travel support can be of two types. **

**1\. Grants **

**2\. interestless loans **

**The second one should be easy to work out. Few years back I was in need of a travel support when I had an opportunity to present one of my projects in a prestigious event abroad. The organizers were reimbursing the travel expenses but I had to advance it to make the arrangements. I tried to get support from many such govt programs (including startup mission) in vain. If such a travel support can be arranged, it is not an expense per say. As the candidate will repay it when she gets the reimbursement.**

**praveen: We expect ICFOSS to intevene when some departments of govt go against its on stated IT policy of promoting FOSS**.

"Thanks"

**Hrishi: Are you saying the fonts should be release ready by October ?**

**Anivar: Few points i want to list are fixing institutional behaviour to foss communities **

**1. ICFOSS need to be a facilitator for both foss projects and foss requirements of government .  It is should not a big fat research only org/  funding platform/ ownership holder foss communi produced work. **

**Maintaining  a fair balance is the key .**

**Saying this because i invested efforts in past at icfoss and later seen many if those values washing away in last 4 years**

**Anivar: 2. Major gap i see in this process is empowering room for free software choices and suggestions in government. I know it is not easy, but it is a continuous battle. This need policy briefs within government,  documenting best practices and more story telling based on foss projects and their adoptions .**

**Anivar: 3. . Initiate and build institutional support for volunary initiatives and help them to be sustainable  communities . Eg. Building a Kerala rescue based preparedness stack  (i heard some good initiatives happening)**

**Anivar: 4. Research Partnership with foss orgs and communities in kerala and outside. Facilitiate value for foss projects via this associations , more contributors, mentors , cross community  expertise curation etc**

**This will avoid indian foss projects searching for FOSSASIA type orgs abroad to provide org home**

"Anivar valid points and will take it up"

"Regarding Kerala rescue, we need some one to rescue, because all the free credits of Cloud is over and no funds earmarked, and now an institutional arragemt is being made with SDMA to channelise finds for.the cloud through ICFOSS as they can tranfer amount only to a govt entity to be "Safe" and accidentally we haveinformedthem"

**Anivar: 5. Not all foss projects  are not in a possition to build campus presence . Use campus presence for ICFOSS for joint/partnered event organizing help. Communities can easily provide expertise while organizing efforts can be done by icfoss's campus representatives.**

**6. Build and maintain a  High priority projects as per the governance + local needs . Priorities  contributions to this  via a task based / bounty based support structure**

"Reg pt 6 request from.govt to have a locale specific version of GNU khata and to enable GST and contact less QR based or digital transaction and community members should provide support locally to small pan shops and SME"

"KTUs Anil  Student coordinator has assured all support to mobilize the students as well, also earn while you work can also be leveraged."

**Anivar: 7. Decouple startup /product / event/ certificate focused campus club structure to contribution based model. contribution  shouldnt be code alone.**

**8. Use Open organization structure to maximum extend , use issue trackers and build transparancy around programs, planning and participation. Invest efforts in addressing issues . This will avoid a lot of conflicts even though it may be a bit difficult in start. **

**Changing an org culture is hard. But i am sure sabarish's willingness is a very positive step**

**General points**

"Let's do it, not just chasing wild dreams but fix up a measurable outcomes as vividly pointed out, and have a plan of action agreeable to a majority."

"So let me conclude
